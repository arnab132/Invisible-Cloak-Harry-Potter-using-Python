Invisibility Cloak

Let us create our own Invisibility cloak using Python's OpenCV python package.

Features:

It works based on Background detection and Colour detection.
Here you can adjust the colours of the cloak by changing the H values of the lower and upper red limits. In this code we have taken red coloured cloak so the value is from 10-170.
For the colour codes or the HSV values of green and blue colours refer the web. Green starts from 120-180.
You can adjust the saturation and brightness values by changing the S and V values.
First show the webcam towards the background as it is the mask1 of the code and then show the cloak as it the mask 2 of the code.
The code is basically the Superimposition of the two - 2 images.

Pre-requisites/ Libraries:
